# test1-ertelecom
Write a function that provides change directory (cd) function for an abstract file system.

Notes:

Root path is '/'.
Path separator is '/'.
Parent directory is addressable as '..'.
Directory names consist only of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z).
The function should support both relative and absolute paths.
The function will not be passed any invalid paths.
Do not use built-in path-related functions.

For example:

```
path = Path('/a/b/c/d')
path.cd('../x')
print(path.current_path)
should display '/a/b/c/x'.
```
